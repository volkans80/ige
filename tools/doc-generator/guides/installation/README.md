#Installation
##Single or Multiplayer?
If you intend to use the Isogenic Engine's multiplayer stream system you will need to have a server with Node.js setup. If you are not developing a multiplayer game you can skip this step.
Open a command prompt, change to the ige/server folder e.g. cd /ige/server and then execute:

    npm install

All of the engine's dependencies will then be installed under the /ige/server/node_modules folder.
