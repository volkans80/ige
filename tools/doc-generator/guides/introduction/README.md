#Introduction
Isogenic Engine is a client and server-side JavaScript system that provides a scene-graph with built-in multiplayer functionality. Simulations running on the server-side can be automatically streamed to all connected clients, or sectioned off into distinct rooms in which only those clients that are participating receive updates.

The engine fully supports both 2d and isometric rendering and can run either with or without multiplayer functionality. A build system is also included to automatically scan your final game code, detect the sections of the Isogenic API that you have used and minify your game and Isogenic into the smallest possible package ready for deployment.
